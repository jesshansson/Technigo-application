  <div class= "div2">
   <p> Mob programming is a collaborative approach to software development, where a team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. <br> The team consists of everyone involved the project, often including the customers.
    The work is usually accomplished in workshops or working meetings, and the approach can be used for single steps as well as the entire development project. 
    <br> 
    <br>
    Benefits of mob programming can include <br>
    -	Solving communication problems, thanks to direct dialouge with the whole team <br>
    -	Fast decision processes<br>
    -	Fast feedback and help<br>
    -	Ensures the project fully meets the coding standards and expectations (more participants to review the work)<br>
    -	And of course; boosts work morale – the more the merrier!
